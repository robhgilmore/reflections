What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It adds a .git file to your folder, officially creating a repository.
You have to do it because without a .git folder none of your
changes are tracked.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
Hmm. I don't fuckin know lol. s

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

Branches are helpful when you're doing something new, something that you don't want to fuck up
your master branch. They can be helpful for allowing people to work
on new features without possibly fucking up the master branch.
